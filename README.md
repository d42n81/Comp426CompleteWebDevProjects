This repository holds my programming assignments from Comp426 Intro to Web Development. 
These projects used a mix of Javascript, React, JQuery, Axios, Node.Js, HTML, and Bulma CSS. 
Assignment 01 is a simple superhero wiki that displays information all about Batman. It is a 2 page site built using HTML and Bulma CSS.
Asignment 03 is a series of pure programming challenges in Javascript focusing on creating efficient time complexity for Array and LinkedList sorting. 
Assignment 04 reads information from a database to display information and images from various superheroes. Uses JS Bulma and Axios.
Assignment 05 builds upon Assignment 4 by redesigning it in JQuery.
Assignment 06 is a timing experiment involving Javascript promises and asynchronous functions.
Assignment 07 is my version of 2048 programmed in pure JS and Bulma CSS. 
Assignment 08 is a chat app using Javascript Bulma and Axios to handle HTTP requests. 
Assignment 09 is my version of a Twitter style social media. The app uses Javascript, React, and JQuery to handle the logic of displaying tweets. The app uses Axios to perform CRUD operations on a class server of tweets.
